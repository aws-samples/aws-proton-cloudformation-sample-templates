## READ THIS

Proton is making breaking API changes in preparation for our launch into the SDK.  The rollout will take place May 26-early June.  If Proton doesn't work using the instructions from the `main` branch, please try this, as the region you are targeting may not have been deployed to yet.

## AWS Proton sample templates

This repository is a curated list of sample templates to use with AWS Proton. AWS Proton is an application delivery service available at [aws.amazon.com/proton](https://aws.amazon.com/proton).

To use this repository, browse to the folder that corresponds to the template that you want to use. You will find there all the information you need to create environment and service templates and to deploy the corresponding environments and services. You will also find a link to a repository with basic code that runs on each one of them, in case you want to fork it to use it as the basis for your deployment.
